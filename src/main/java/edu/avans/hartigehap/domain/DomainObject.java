     * This hashCode() implementation violates an important property: - The id

     * is not set (so null). During invocation of the persist method, the id is
     * provided by the ORM provider. After being persisted, the id is immutable
     * (as a good id is being supposed to behave). - The result of this
     * violation is that if the entities are used as keys in a HashSet or
     * HashMap, they will become lost when being persisted.
     * 
     * This is the equals() implementation taken from
     * http://www.onjava.com/pub/a

     * and persisting of the entity, where the id is not set and therefore null.
     * 
     * The properties are as follows: - if two non-persisted entities are
     * compared, they are by definition unequal. This allow storing them in a
     * set, even before being persisted. - if two persisted entities are
     * compared, they are compared based on their surrogate id (no other
     * information from the object is used). - if a persisted an a non-persisted
     * entity are compared, they are by definition unequal.
